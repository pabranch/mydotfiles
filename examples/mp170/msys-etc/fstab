#fstab
#Currently /etc/fstab is only read during dll initialization.
#
#The line format is simple in that you give the Win32 path, followed by one or
#more space or tab delimiter, followed by the mount point.  Mount points in 
#typical UNIX environments must be a physical name on a drive before it can 
#actually be used as a mount point.  In this implementation the "must exist" 
#requirement isn't enforced, however, it will be an aide to such programs as 
#find and readline's tab completion if it does exist.

#Blank lines are ignored.
